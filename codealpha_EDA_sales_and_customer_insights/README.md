# 📊 Sales & Customer Behaviour Insights  
## Task: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## 👩‍💼 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on sales, customer, and product datasets to uncover meaningful insights and prepare the data for advanced visualization and decision-making.

The objective of this task is to **understand the data deeply before building dashboards or models**, identify trends, detect anomalies, and validate business assumptions using statistical and visual analysis.

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Analysis
- Understand the structure, variables, and data types in the dataset  
- Identify missing values, inconsistencies, and potential data quality issues  
- Analyze customer behaviour and purchasing patterns  
- Discover trends and patterns in sales performance  
- Generate insights that can support business and strategic decisions  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The analysis was conducted using the following datasets:

| Dataset Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `sales_data.csv` | Transaction-level sales data including order details |
| `customer_info.csv` | Customer demographics and loyalty information |
| `product_info.csv` | Product categories, pricing, and attributes |

These datasets were combined and analyzed to provide a holistic view of sales and customer behaviour.

## 🔍 EDA Methodology (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Data
- Loaded datasets and examined their structure  
- Reviewed column names, data types, and sample records  
- Identified key variables relevant to business analysis  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Quality Checks
- Identified missing and null values  
- Checked for duplicate records  
- Validated date formats and numerical consistency  
- Noted data issues requiring preprocessing before visualization  

### 3️⃣ Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed distributions of numerical variables such as sales and discounts  
- Examined frequency distributions of categorical variables like region, category, and loyalty tier  

### 4️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Explored relationships between discounts and sales  
- Compared sales performance across regions and product categories  
- Analyzed customer loyalty tiers and purchasing behaviour  

### 5️⃣ Statistical & Visual Exploration
- Used descriptive statistics (mean, median, count)  
- Visualized trends using bar charts, histograms, and box plots  
- Identified outliers and unusual patterns in the data

## 📈 Key Insights
- Sales performance varies significantly across regions  
- Loyal customers tend to generate higher average order values  
- Certain product categories consistently outperform others  
- Discounts influence purchasing behaviour and order value  
- Data preprocessing is essential before building dashboards
